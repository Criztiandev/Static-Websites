Hi, my name is Criztian Jade M Tuplano, and I am also known as criztiandev. As a frontend developer with one year of experience, I am always striving to polish my skills and become better at what I do. I firmly believe that a smooth and efficient development process is essential for success in this field.

That being said, I am thrilled to announce my latest project: recreating the React development environment using only HTML and CSS. This project is driven by two primary motivations. Firstly, I am captivated by the aesthetic appeal of the React.dev interface, and I am eager to replicate its design using my HTML and CSS skills. Secondly, I am also excited to put my CSS and HTML skills to the test and take them to the next level without relying on my favorite frameworks.

Through this project, I push myself to new heights, deepen my understanding of CSS and HTML, and achieve a level of mastery that will benefit me in my future endeavors.

## **What I've Learned**

Through this project, I have learned the following:

1.  Through this project, I realized the importance of proper planning in HTML structure. Instead of relying on generic div and span elements, utilizing semantic HTML tags can significantly speed up the engine. This realization has taught me the value of optimizing code for performance.
2.  One of my proudest accomplishments in this project is my improved proficiency in using advanced CSS selectors. Rather than relying on a plethora of class names, I have utilized these selectors to streamline my code. I am excited to continue utilizing these advanced techniques in CSS to elevate my skills to the next level.
3.  A valuable lesson I learned during this project is to prioritize targeting the most common components before moving on to the unique ones. This approach can significantly expedite the website creation process by focusing on the most crucial elements first.
4.  To speed up my development process, I have developed a strategy that involves following a simple step-by-step process. By implementing this method, I can create websites ten times faster than before.
5.  This project also highlighted my areas for improvement in HTML and CSS skills. Moving forward, I plan to build more static sites to strengthen my foundational skills before tackling more complex projects.

## **Technologies Used**

The project was developed using the following technologies:

- HTML: Used for structuring and presenting content on the web.
- CSS: Utilized to style and layout the HTML elements.
- JavaScript: Used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to the project.
